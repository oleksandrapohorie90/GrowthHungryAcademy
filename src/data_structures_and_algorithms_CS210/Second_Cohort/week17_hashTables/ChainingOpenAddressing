types of hash tables:
used for hashing: a key value pair, you hash the key and then you need to insert it in the hash table
you hash table is of certain size, you have 100 % slots
you take the key of the key value pair, you hash it and you take modulo 100
the key value pairs are name(str) value(date of birth)

the idea is the name is Alexandra(take a hash of Alexandra) and some big number and take its remainder of dividing by 100

at index 40 - you should insert this pair
what happens if I take another key value pair
key is sofia, what if sofia has the same modulo 100 being 40

1. we have a collision - they both hash to 40 in hash tables
2 methods exist
chaining() - each slot is a linked list, i will insert alexandra and her dob and next element will be sofia and her dob

What is the date of birth of Sofia? but slot 40 is a linked list, if sofia is not there no answer=null, if hse is there i will return her dob
retrieval of hashmap is O(1) => the worst time complexity is linear time
then they will have worst case O(n) complexity

======================================
it is spread as much as possible and probability of them to smash is

2. open addressing
the idea is alexandra is hashed to slot 40 - I store in this slot Alexandra and her dob

sofia is stored in the same slot 40, but I go to next slot and I see it is empty, then I will store sofia at 41, I compute hash of sofia its 40, i will keep looking until I hit an empty slot, till I get sofia, if I get her I return her value

======================================
bloom filters - you have k hash functions, each of them is very different from each other, produce diff results,

Whats hashing functions do you know ? - they produce very random results

you have 3 hashing functions, lets create an array[256] slots
3 hash functions : at this indexes we will make the value equal to 1
at this index we put 1, at this position put 2,
is sofia in this bloom filter or not? K.hash functions
probabilistic data structure
if an answer from bloom filter - no
it happened that 3
when we say a yes-probable yes
when we say a no - its a definite no
is there an element or no ?

recently big bloom filter, good hash functions
bigger array,
