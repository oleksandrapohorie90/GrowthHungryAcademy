Recursion has 2 phases:
void fun(int n)
{
    if (n>0)
    {
    1. Calling time -> Ascending
    2. fun(n-1)*2
    3. Returning time -> Descending
    }
}

Recursion with loop -  only will have ascending phase
Recursion without - will have both


void fun(int n){
if(n>0)}
print("n")
fun(n-1)
}
}
void main{
int x=3;
fun(x);
}
