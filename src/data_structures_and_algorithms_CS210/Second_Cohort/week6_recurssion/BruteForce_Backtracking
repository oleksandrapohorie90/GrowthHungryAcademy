Backtracking - one of the problem solving strategies;
using this approach we can use Brute Force approach - for any given problem you should try out all possible solutions and pick up desired solutions
we will do it in Dynamic programing - when solving optimal solutions

Backtracking - when we have multiple solutions and we want all those solutions
EX: 3 students
B1 B2 B3 in how many ways can we arrange 3 students n=3 => in 3! ways
How to find all possible arrangements ?
State Space Tree
Bounding Function - when restriction is introduced

N-queens problem, coloring problem

Branch and Bound

Backtracking follows DFS
