Symbols:
::= means “may expand into” and “may get replaced with.”

Every name in Backus-Naur form is surrounded by angle brackets, < >, whether it appears on the left- or right-hand side of the rule.
An expansion is an expression containing terminal symbols and non-terminal symbols, joined together by sequencing and selection.
A terminal symbol may be a literal like (“+” or “function”) or a category of literals (like integer).

A vertical bar | indicates choice.
A terminal could be a quoted literal (like “+”, “switch” or ” “<<=”) or the name of a category of literals (like integer).
