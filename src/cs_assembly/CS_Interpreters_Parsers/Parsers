Syntax analysis: if we have an assignment we have right/left side, semicolon
================
we construct an AST during syntax analysis: to make sure it is processed by compiler to run the code
x+1, but we never declared x, parser says ok but symantic analysis will warn we never defined x variable

Interpreter
Compiler

Lexer issue: variable name cannot start w/ a digit    =>      int 123abc = 10;
Parser issue: missing expression after assignment     =>      int x = ;
Interpreter issue: division by zero                   =>      int y = 10/0;

Tree graph where we have nodes
All expressions go through lexers, parsers and then parser needs to verify

expression is a term or term+ smth
3     +   5 * (10 - 4)
term      valid expression <= Rule 1
|
factor => factor can be  number or parenthesis(we dont have any in the below example)
|
number

<expression> ::= <term> | <term> "+" <expression> | <term> - <expression>
<term> ::= <factor> | <factor> "*" <term> | <factor> "/" <term>
