Syntax analysis: if we have an assignment we have right/left side, semicolon
================
we construct an AST during syntax analysis: to make sure it is processed by compiler to run the code
x+1, but we never declared x, parser says ok but symantic analysis will warn we never defined x variable

Interpreter
Compiler

Lexer issue: variable name cannot start w/ a digit    =>      int 123abc = 10;
Parser issue: missing expression after assignment     =>      int x = ;
Interpreter issue: division by zero                   =>      int y = 10/0;

Tree graph where we have nodes
All expressions go through lexers, parsers and then parser needs to verify
==============================================================================
expression is a term or term+ smth
3     +   5 * (10 - 4)
term      valid expression <= Rule 1 => but expression is left and right plus or minus, we have left and right thats it, so it is a term, we cannot say the whole thing left side minus smth
|             |
factor       term plus smth/minus smth
|              |
number       factor * term => Rule 2 => factor is 5(as to be a factor, we need to verify it), but factor is a num or expression in parenthesis, so its a number
              |         |
             number   term is a factor mult by smth by term or divided
                        |
                      factor => Rule 3
                        |
                      parenthesis expression => Rule 4 - can be a number or parenthesis expression "(" => 10 -4 has to be a valid expression
                        |              |
                      term    -     expression
                       |                   |
                      factor>>number=10   can be a term >> number = 4
 => factor can be  number or parenthesis(we dont have any in the below example)

<expression> ::= <term> | <term> "+" <expression> | <term> - <expression>
<term> ::= <factor> | <factor> "*" <term> | <factor> "/" <term>
<factor> ::= <number> | "(" <expression> ")"
=====================================================================
for "3+5*(10-4)" Lexer produced this:
Tokens:
Token {type=NUMBER, value='3'}
Token {type=PLUS, value='+'}
Token {type=NUMBER, value='5'}
Token {type=MULTIPLY, value='*'}
Token {type=LPAREN, value='('}
Token {type=NUMBER, value='10'}
Token {type=MINUS, value='-'}
Token {type=NUMBER, value='4'}
Token {type=RPAREN, value=')'}

BNF FOR ARITHMETIC EXPRESSIONS:
<expression> ::= <term> | <term> "+" <expression> | <term> "-" <expression>
<term> ::= <factor> | <factor> "*" <term> | <factor> "/" <term>
<factor> ::= <number> | "(" <expression> ")"

simplify and say we want to support multiplication and division => 3 * 8 * 7 / 1 => term
                                                                  everything is a term and term is a factor times or divide by term
<expression> ::= <term>
<term> ::= <factor> | <factor> "*" <term> | <factor> "/" <term>
<factor> ::= <number>

=========================
Parser that receives tokens
Construction of the tree - everything is a node - node is a binary operation like * / OR just a number: 2 types
