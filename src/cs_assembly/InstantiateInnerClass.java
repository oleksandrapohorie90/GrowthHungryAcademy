public class InstantiateInnerClass {
//    To instantiate an inner class, you must first instantiate the outer class. Then, create the inner object within the outer object with this syntax:

//    OuterClass outerObject = new OuterClass();
//    OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();

    //Constructor
//    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {
//        gear = startGear;
//        cadence = startCadence;
//        speed = startSpeed;
//    }
//    To create a new Bicycle object called myBike, a constructor is called by the new operator:
//
//    Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle(30, 0, 8);
//new Bicycle(30, 0, 8) creates space in memory for the object and initializes its fields.
//
//    Although Bicycle only has one constructor, it could have others, including a no-argument constructor:
//
//    public Bicycle() {
//        gear = 1;
//        cadence = 10;
//        speed = 0;
//    }
//    Bicycle yourBike = new Bicycle(); invokes the no-argument constructor to create a new Bicycle object called yourBike.
