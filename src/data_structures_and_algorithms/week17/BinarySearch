-Binary searching the answer
-Standard application:
1. search space - for ex indexes of the array
int left = 0;
int right = n - 1;

2.while loop and condition untill when binary search is executed, execute till search space is exhausted
while(left<=right) -> there are nums btw left and right, till this interval contains 1 element - we keep searching
