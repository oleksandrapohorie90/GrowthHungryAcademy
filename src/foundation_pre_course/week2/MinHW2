1) Express arithmetic series in sigma notation ?
S = 5 + 9 + 13 ... 89
1. each number increases by 4, so we have an arithmetic sequence
2. form of arithmetic sequence:
an = a1 + (n-1) * d
an=nth term in the sequence
a1=5
d=4
an = 5 +(n-1) * 4 = 5 + 4n-4 = 4n + 1

3.to find n:
89 = 4n + 1
89-1=4n
88=4n
n=22 - there are 22 terms in the series

4. write terms in sigma notation
    22
S = ∑(4n + 1) sum up 4n+1 for n starting from 1 to 22
   n=1

2)
1. rewrite arithmetic series
  15
  ∑(2k+1) to start at k=1
  k=3

  k=3 k1=1 => k1=k-2
  k=k1+2

  Original expression: 2k+1
  Now k=k1+2 => 2(k1+2)+1 =2k1 + 4 +1 = 2k1 + 5 <----
2. adjust limits
original summation ends at k=15
substitute k1+2=15 => k1=13
when k=15, k1=13

  13
  ∑(2k1+5)
  k=1
