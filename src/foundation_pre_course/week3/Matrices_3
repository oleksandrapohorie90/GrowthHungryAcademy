Matrices, Inverse, Row operations :
3 X 3 matrix
[ 1 2 3 ]
  4 5 6
  7 8 9

           A
       n columns
m rows [        ]   m X n
! to multiply these 2 matrices n columns should equal n rows !
*          B
       k columns
n rows [        ]   n X k

How to multiply 2 matrices:
=
           C
       [  (i,j) ]   m X k
C_i,j = ith row(in matrix A) * jth column(in matrix B) will be their dot product
   3         2
2[1 2 3]  3[1 2] =
  4 5 6     3 4
            5 6
2 X 3     3 X 2  = 2 X 2 => [ 1*1 + 2*3 + 3*5 = 22 1*2 + 2*4 + 3*6 = 28
r   c     r   c               4*1 + 5*3 + 6*5 = 49 4*2 + 5*4 + 6*6 = 64
                 = [ 22 28 ]
                     49 64
TO exponentiate : matrix ^ 2
keep multiplying by itself
===================================
Row Echelon form - when you have a matrix [ 1 a b c ] <- 3 X 4
                                            0 1 d e
                                            0 0 1 f   <- REF form
                                            if you have 1's under the diagonal and under that diagonal you have 0's
THEN => We can express sets of linear equations as matrices:

Reduced and rref - when you starts with A_n matrix and draw the line and write identity matrix on the right 1 in thE DIAGONAL and 0's under it, and bring A_n to Identity matrix and apply all of the operations, then you will achieve another matrix B_n <- the Invere matrix of A_n
If you have A_n and B_n is the inverse matrix and you multiply them then you have I_n
AA^-1 = I <-inverse

Inverse and rref
