root is such a value that the value of this polynomial is 0
f(n) = anx^n + an-1x^n-1+...a1x+a0
f(ri)=0
n=7
an doesnt = 0
i=√-1

Roots of quadratic
quadratic expression
there is a formula to get the roots of this quadratic
ax^2 + bx + c
1. D = b^2-4ac
x1,2 = (-b +- √D) / 2a

cubic equations roots
ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0
ax^4 +bx^3 +cx^ +dx +e =0

degree 5 and higher polynomials dont have formula to find roots
