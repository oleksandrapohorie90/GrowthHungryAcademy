f(x) = 3x + 2
x - input
3x+2 - single output it produces
if a function for single input produces 2 outputs-illegal, not function

1. f(x) = x+2
y = x+2
x^2 + y^2 = 1
y^2 = 1 - x^2
y = +-sqrt1-x^2 => not a proper function bc why has 2 outputs

relates to concept of inverse functions
1. injective(one to one) - each output has at most 1 input or 0
2. surjective(onto) - at least one input(more) for each output
3. bijective(one to one and onto) - exactly one input for each output

function:
f(x) = y -> plug in input and it gives you the output

inverse function(only bijective functions):
f^-1(y) = x -> plug in output and it gives you the input

Q: How to find an inverse of a function?
f(x) = 3x + 2
y = 3x + 2
1. swap
2. solve for y
x = 3y + 2
x-2 = 3y
y = (x-2)/3 => the inverse of f(x) = 3x + 2 is f^-1(y) = (y-2)/3 why y ?

Piecewise functions
=====================
f(x) = x^2 if x<0
       x   if x>=0

Domain: set of all possible inputs
f(x) = 1/x
D = R(all possible nums, -1, fractional nums-Pi, except 0-cannot divide by 0)

Range: set of all possible outputs
f(x) = x^2
xED
D=R
then range is R+ incl. 0 - all positive real numbers, bc x^2 >= 0
so possible outputs any positive real numbers and 0


Interval notation
=======================
[0;3] - [ including
(-infinity; 1] - ( not including
