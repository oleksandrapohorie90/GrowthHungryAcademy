1. global maximum - y value that this function achieves
2. global min - the min point function achieves through out it

3. local max - such points that you reach and functions starts to decrease
4. local min - such points that you reach and functions starts to increase

inflection points: at this point the curve cherve changes not a smile but a frawn

discontinuity types: removable discontinuity, infinite discontinuity, jump discontinuity(piecewise function), oscillating discontinuity(y=sin1/x)

intercepts coordinates:
y=3x-1
y=0 -> x intercept
0=3x-1
x=1/3

x=0 -> y-intercept
y=3*0-1
y=-1


Average rate of change - slope of a line of a linear function
=============================================================
if we are given 2 points and they are lying on the line
slope(m) = rise/run = y/x = y2-y1/x2-x1=avg rate of change
y=mx+b

b=
