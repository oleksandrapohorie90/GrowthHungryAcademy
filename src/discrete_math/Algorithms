How would you describe your algorithm in simple English ? -Pseudocode(smth btw english and real code)
1. List all steps used by Algorithm 1 to find the max ?
procedure max (a1,a2,an: integers)
max=nums,
 foreach n : nums
    if max < n {max=n}
    return max

 Algorithms are finite as well - should produce an output after a finite number for any input:
 (1)input/(2)output/(3)correct/(4)finitenize

 a) procedure double (n: positive int)
 while n>0
 n:=2n -> this loop is Infinite, not finite (4)

 b) procedure divide (n: positive int)
     while n>=0 -> it will finish but w/ runtime error, divides by 0
     m:=1/n     -> (3) (2)
     n:=n-1

 c) procedure sum (n: positive int)
     sum:=0
     while i < 10
     sum:=sum+i -> we dont see i++, no input(1), output ->(2), not correct(3), not finite(4)

 d) procedure choose (a,b: int)
 x: = either a or b
return x     -> looks correct
=========================================================
examples of algos problems: searching, sorting, optimization

1. Algorithm in increasing order and produce the list of all values that occur more than once:

answer = empty list
for i=2 to n
    if ai==ai-1
    answer.append(ai)

return answer
