Adapter(Wrapper) - allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface

Bridge - decouple abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
interface car and a lot of implementations of interface car

Composite -

Decorator - allows some behavior to be added to some object dynamically without impacting other instances of the class
