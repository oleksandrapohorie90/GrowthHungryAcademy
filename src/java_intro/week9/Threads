process-independent execution until with separate memoty space
thread-lightweight, shares memory within the same process. allows resource sharing but requires synchronization

each process has multiple threads
each thread has a single process, threads share the same memory

threads +:
enhance performance
allow parallel tasks
responsive UI

Java abstracts thread management with classes/libraries that makes multithreading easier

Concurrency model - shared memory model where threads can access shared data and objects

Garbage collection - releasing memory that is no longer used
Deamon threads - if no longer used threads, program terminates
Runnable or Thread class can be extended and override run() method
