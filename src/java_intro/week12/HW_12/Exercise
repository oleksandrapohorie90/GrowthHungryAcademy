Create a simple, multi-threaded online chat application using Java. This project will integrate
concepts of concurrency, SQL for data persistence, and networking for communication.

Key Features:
1. Multi-threading:
○ Use threads to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
○ Implement a thread pool for efficient resource management.

2. Networking:
○ Use TCP sockets for client-server communication.
○ Implement protocols for message exchange (e.g., JSON).

3. SQL Database:
○ Store user data, chat history, and other relevant information in a SQL
database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
○ Use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with the database.

Breakdown of Tasks:
Part 1 - Persistence
Manage user data and chat history in MySQL database.

Part 2 - Server-side
1. Create a server socket to listen for incoming connections.
2. Handle client connections using threads.
3. Implement message broadcasting and private messaging.

Part 3 - Client-side
4. Establish a connection to the server.
5. Allow users to send and receive messages.
6. Handle user input and display messages.
