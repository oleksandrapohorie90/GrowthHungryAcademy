=> communication btw applications running on different devices over a network
=> TCP/IP - suite of protocols that governs communication over the internet. Its like a set of rules that computers follow to send and receive data
usually when you write program underneath it relies on communication of some server it relies on

1. TCP(transmission control protocol) - delivers data accurately and in order, you establish connection before data transfer
reliable connections, connection oriented, order preserved, used in most cases
classes: Socket, ServerSocket, URL, HttpURLConnection

2. UDP - doesn't guarantee deliver order, doesnt require connection, video gaming, streaming, real time connections
unreliable connections
