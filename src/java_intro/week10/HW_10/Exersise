Simulate a parking lot with a fixed number of parking spots (e.g., 5).
Use a Semaphore to control access to the parking spots.
Create multiple threads representing cars:
A car thread waits for an available spot, parks for a random amount of time, and then leaves.
Print messages indicating when a car parks and leaves.
Requirements:
Use Semaphore.acquire() and Semaphore.release() appropriately.
Simulate at least 10 cars attempting to park.
