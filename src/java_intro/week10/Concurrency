ability of a program to execute multiple tasks simultaniously
-minim CPU usage
-faster task completion
dont control execution order, you dont know what order of threads execution
Challenges of Threading
=======================
Data race is a type of race condition that occurs when 2 or more threads access a shared var concurrently, and at least 1 of the accesses is a write operation. This leads to data corruption.

Deadlocks - condition where improper structure program can get into where execution cant proceed. threads are waiting for execution but cant proceed.
-use consisting locking
-avoid nested locks
-use tryLock to prevent indefinite blocking
===========================================
Concurrency utilities in Java
-tools, mechanisms to manage multi-threading programming

Locks: provide THREAD synchronisation by controlling access to critical sections
    a.ReentrantLock:same thread to acquire th lock multiple times
    b.ReadWriteLock:separates read and write access for better performance
**increment operations can be protected by the lock
**useful for section of code to execute 1 at a time and not multiple in the same time
