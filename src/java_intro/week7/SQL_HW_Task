Part 2: Build and Query a Library Database
Objective: Create a library management database in SQLite. Practice using SQL
commands to create tables, insert data, and write queries.
Step 1: Setup
1. Download and install SQLite if you haven't already.
2. Open your SQLite environment and create a new database called library.db.
Step 2: Create Tables
1. Books: Create a table to store information about books.
○ Columns: book_id (INTEGER, Primary Key), title (TEXT), author
(TEXT), genre (TEXT), published_year (INTEGER), available
(BOOLEAN).
2. Members: Create a table to store information about library members.
○ Columns: member_id (INTEGER, Primary Key), first_name (TEXT),
last_name (TEXT), membership_date (DATE).
3. Borrowings: Create a table to record which books are borrowed by members.
○ Columns: borrowing_id (INTEGER, Primary Key), book_id (INTEGER,
Foreign Key referencing Books), member_id (INTEGER, Foreign Key
referencing Members), borrowed_date (DATE), return_date (DATE).
Step 3: Insert Seed Data
Insert sample data for testing and queries.
1. Books: Add at least 5 different books with varying genres and authors.
2. Members: Add at least 3 library members.
3. Borrowings: Add records showing which members have borrowed which books,
along with the borrowing and return dates.
Step 4: Practice Queries
Write SQL queries to answer the following questions:
1. All Books: List all books in the library.
2. Available Books: Retrieve only the books that are currently available.
3. Members who Borrowed Books: Show each member’s name and the titles of
books they have borrowed.
4. Books by Genre: List all books grouped by genre.
5. Count of Borrowed Books: Find out how many books each member has borrowed.
6. Overdue Books: List all books that have been borrowed for more than 30 days.
7. Most Recent Borrowing: Retrieve the most recent borrowing record.
Step 5: Advanced Queries (Bonus)
1. Popular Books: Find the book that has been borrowed the most times.
2. Average Borrowing Duration: Calculate the average number of days a book is
borrowed before being returned.
