Problem 13 — Fibonacci Induction Proof
We prove this using the principle of mathematical induction. The base case is
n=1, and in that case, the statement to be proved is just:
𝑓1=𝑓2
This is true since both values are 1.

Inductive Step: Assume the inductive hypothesis:
𝑓1+𝑓3+ ... +𝑓2n-1 = 𝑓2𝑛
Try to prove the corresponding statement for 𝑛+1 namely:
𝑓1+𝑓3+ ... +𝑓2n-1 +𝑓2n+1 = +𝑓2n+2 - by inductive hypothesis
We have:
𝑓1+𝑓3+ ... +𝑓2𝑛−1+𝑓2𝑛+1=𝑓2𝑛+𝑓2𝑛+1 = 𝑓2𝑛+2 - by definition of Fib numbers

Problem 25
a) Since we can generate all even integers by starting with 0 and repeatedly adding or subtracting 2, a simple recursive way to define this set is:
0 ∈ 𝑆
If 𝑥∈𝑆 then x+2 ∈ 𝑆 and 𝑥−2 ∈ 𝑆

b) The smallest positive integer congruent to 2 modulo 3 is 2, so declare 2∈S. All the others can be obtained by adding multiples of 3. So the inductive step is:
If x∈S, then x+3∈S

c) The positive integers not divisible by 5 are those congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5. Therefore we define:
1,2,3,4∈S
If x∈S, then x+5∈S
