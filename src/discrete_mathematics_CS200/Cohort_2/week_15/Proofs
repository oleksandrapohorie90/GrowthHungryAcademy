1. Trivial - if we know q is true then p->q is true
2. Vacuous - if we know p is false then p->q is true
3. Direct - assume p is true and use rules of inference, axioms, logical equivalences to show q is true
4. Contraposition (indirect proof) - assume not q and prove not p is true
prove n is odd -> assume n is even
