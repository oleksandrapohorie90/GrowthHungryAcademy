1. Trivial - if we know q is true then p->q is true
if it is raining then 1=1

2. Vacuous - if we know p is false then p->q is true
if i am both rich and poor, then 2+2=5

3. Direct - assume p is true and use rules of inference, axioms, logical equivalences to show q is true

4. Contraposition (indirect proof) - assume not q and prove not p is true
prove n is odd -> assume n is even
rational
even

if not q -> not p =>> p->q

5. Contradiction
