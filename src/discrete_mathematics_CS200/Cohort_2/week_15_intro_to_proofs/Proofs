1.7 - 1.8

1. Trivial - if we know q is true then p->q is true
if it is raining then 1=1

2. Vacuous - if we know p is false then p->q is true
if i am both rich and poor, then 2+2=5

3. Direct - assume p is true and use rules of inference, axioms, logical equivalences to show q is true

4. Contraposition (indirect proof) - assume not q and prove not p is true
prove n is odd -> assume n is even
rational
even

if not q -> not p =>> p->q

5. Contradiction p->q =>> not p OR q
assume p AND not q is true and derive a contradiction(prove its not possible)

assume not q is true and you arrive to q so its a conradiction

EX. prove there is no largest prime number =>> assume there is a largest prime number

Ex. prove sqrt of 2 is irrational by contradiction
assume sqrt of 2 is rational
===========================
existence proofs:
1. constructive proof
-find an explicit value of c such that P(c) is true
-then ExP(x) is true by existential generalization (EG)
2. nonconstructive
-assume no c exists such that P(c) is true and derive a contradiction
============================
uniqueness proofs

Proof strategies for proving p->q or not q -> not p:
1. forward: start w/ p and prove q
2. or backward reasoning: when trying to prove q find a statement p such that we can prove p->q
