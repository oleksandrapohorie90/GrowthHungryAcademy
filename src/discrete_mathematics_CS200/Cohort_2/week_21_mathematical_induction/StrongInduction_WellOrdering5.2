We can form the following amounts of money as indicated:
2 = 2,
4 = 2 + 2,
5 = 5,
6 = 2 + 2 + 2.
By having considered all the combinations, we know that the gaps in this list ($1 and $3) cannot be filled. We claim that we can form all amounts of money greater than or equal to $5.

Let P(n) be the statement that we can form n dollars using just 2-dollar and 5-dollar bills.
We want to prove that P(n) is true for all n ≥ 5.

We already observed that the basis step is true for n = 5 and 6.
Assume the inductive hypothesis, that P(j) is true for all j with 5 ≤ j ≤ k, where k is a fixed integer greater than or equal to 6.

We want to show that P(k + 1) is true.
Because k – 1 ≥ 5, we know that P(k – 1) is true, that is, that we can form k – 1 dollars.
Add another 2-dollar bill, and we have formed k + 1 dollars, as desired.

Let P(n) be the statement that there is no positive integer b such that √2 = n / b.

Basis step: P(1) is true because √2 > 1 ≥ 1/b for all positive integers b.

Inductive step: Assume that P(j) is true for all j ≤ k, where k is an arbitrary positive integer; we must prove that P(k + 1) is true.

Assume the contrary:
√2 = (k + 1)/b for some positive integer b.
Squaring both sides and clearing fractions:
→ 2b² = (k + 1)²
→ (k + 1)² is even → k + 1 is even → k is odd.

So we write k + 1 = 2t → 2b² = 4t² → b² = 2t² → b = 2s.
Then √2 = (k + 1)/b = (2t)/(2s) = t/s → contradicts inductive hypothesis.
Therefore, P(k + 1) is also true, and the proof is complete.

Base cases:
If n = 1 = 4·0 + 1, first player loses.
If n = 2, 3, 4, first player can win by removing matches.

Assume strong inductive hypothesis:
With k or fewer matches:

First player wins if k ≡ 0, 2, or 3 (mod 4)

Second player wins if k ≡ 1 (mod 4)

Let the game have k + 1 matches:

If k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) → remove 3 matches → opponent has k – 2 ≡ 1 (mod 4) → second player wins.

If k + 1 ≡ 2 (mod 4) → remove 1 match → opponent has k ≡ 1 (mod 4) → second player wins.

If k + 1 ≡ 3 (mod 4) → remove 2 matches → opponent has k – 1 ≡ 1 (mod 4) → second player wins.

If k + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 4) → cannot force opponent into losing position → first player loses.

Thus, the proof is complete.

25. Multiple Choice
a) The inductive step lets us conclude P(3), P(5), ... but nothing about P(2), P(4).
b) Correct: We can conclude P(n) is true for all positive integers n, using strong induction.
c) Inductive step gives P(2), P(4), P(8), ..., but nothing about non-powers of 2.
d) Mathematical induction: we can conclude P(n) is true for all positive integers n.

To calculate product a₁a₂...aₙ via parentheses:

n – 1 multiplications are needed no matter how parentheses are placed.

Proof by strong induction:

Basis: n = 1 → 0 multiplications.

Inductive hypothesis: for all k < n, k – 1 multiplications required.

Divide: (a₁a₂...aᵣ) · (aᵣ₊₁...aₙ)

First group needs r – 1 multiplications, second n – r – 1, one final multiplication for the product → total:
(r – 1) + (n – r – 1) + 1 = n – 1, as required.
