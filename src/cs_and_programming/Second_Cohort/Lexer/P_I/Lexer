The goal of a lexer is to break the code into individual words and symbols (called tokens or lexemes) so that the parser can understand it later

Think of it like Google Translate:

It takes in a sentence (your code)

It turns it into basic building blocks (tokens)

Later, those blocks get processed by a parser or interpreter
